# CS300-Portfolio
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In this course, we created an advising assistance program that helped organize and retrieve course information. The goal was to practice choosing and using the right data structures to efficiently store and access course data.
How did you approach the problem? Why are data structures important?
I approached it by analyzing the requirements and considering different data structures. I chose a map to store course data for fast lookups by course number. Understanding data structures is important because they directly affect a program’s performance, especially when dealing with large datasets.
How did you overcome any roadblocks?
One roadblock was testing the application on a restricted school computer. I worked around this by using OnlineGDB to run and test my C++ code and redirected output to a file when needed. I also faced challenges with input parsing, which I solved using stringstream and careful trimming of data.
How has this expanded your approach to designing software?
It’s helped me realize how much planning matters before coding. Thinking about how the program will store, sort, and display data makes the actual development much smoother. I now take more time to plan out my data structures before writing code.
How has it evolved the way you write programs?
I’ve learned to write cleaner, more maintainable code. I use better naming conventions, comment my logic, and break things into smaller functions. I’m also more mindful of how future users or teammates might read or reuse my code.
